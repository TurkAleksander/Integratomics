This repo contains all the necessary materials to run your own positional integration analysis, with methods based on Breitling et al. (2004) and Knijnenburg et al. (2009).
The analysis can be run either directly from R or from within a Docker.

File descriptions:
R_integration_code.r: Code for running the analysis with placeholder directories. It is NOT recommended to run on a local PC, as the permutation tests are highly RAM-intensive.
